# Cybersecurity Badge Courses for Girl Scouts of America

I will be using this repo as a place for course content I've created and used in virtual sessions for the Girl Scouts of America. For more information please refer to my blog post, [Achieving the Cadette Cybersecurity Badge: Teaching Girl Scouts about Cybersecurity](https://juliesparks.io/post/achievingthecadettecybersecuritybadge/).

### Cybersecurity Badges
* Cadette Cybersecurity Basics Badge Virtual Session via Girl Scouts of Citrus, June 13th 2020.
* TBD

### Public Use
In order to help others hold their own sessions, all resources I developed are available for use in this repository.
The presentations are broken up into content slides, demos or activities, interactive Kahoot! quizzes, and then time for questions after each section. 
After the virtual session, I created a PDF of resources for girls who attended to continue learn about security with a mixture of labs, articles, classes, and competitions. 
Neither my slides nor resource guide are comprehensive! 
If you are considering teaching a session, please do and feel free to use my materials and propose improvements via a pull request.
